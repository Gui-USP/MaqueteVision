Recognize an hospital model and gather all the pieces positions using java and opencv.
Each piece was first described in this program (pin color and possible dimensions) and them fixed in the table where a picture was taken from beneath.
What was seen from beneath was the table and its many holes where some were black (unused) or colored (used by the pieces pins).
This program identifies that and links them to each piece discovering their location.


It was a project for an architeturer doctorate degree.
